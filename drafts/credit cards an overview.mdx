I'd like to think that I'm somewhat qualified to talk about credit cards. I've had three so far,
and I've managed to bring my credit score up from a 586 to a 749. I know that to some, 3 credit cards
don't seem like a lot. However, I've done extensive research into credit cards: how they work,
what their uses are, which are useful, and why they are (almost always) a necessity.

I'll attempt to summarize as best I can each facet of a credit card. Then, I'll
follow-up on this post with more in-depth writing that dive into the details.

We'll look at one of the most popular credit cards out there, the Citi Double Cash.

<h2>Card Type - Cash Back</h2>
The reason why it can be useful to get several different cards is because of the
various types that exist. Travel cards, cash back, interest-free financing, student/no
credit, business, and balance transfer cards are among the many categories of credit
cards that exist.
<h2>Annual Fee - $0</h2>
This one's pretty self-explanatory. Some cards charge an annual fee depending upon
how prestigous it is. A few cards have ways of avoiding the fee (usually only in
the first year), but there are many great cards that charge nothing just for holding
the card.

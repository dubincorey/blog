I'd like to think that I'm somewhat qualified to talk about credit cards. I've had three so far,
and I've managed to bring my credit score up from a 586 to a 749. I know that to some, 3 credit cards
don't seem like a lot. However, I've done extensive research into credit cards: how they work,
what their uses are, which are useful, and why they are (almost always) a necessity.

I'll attempt to summarize as best I can each facet of a credit card. Then, I'll
follow-up on this post with more in-depth writing that dives into the details.

We'll look at one of the most popular credit cards out there, the Citi Double Cash.

<h2>Card Type - 2% Cash Back</h2>
<p>
  The reason why it can be useful to get several different cards is because of
  the various types that exist. Travel cards, cash back, interest-free
  financing, student/no credit, business, and balance transfer cards are among
  the many categories of credit cards that exist.
</p>
<h2>Annual Fee - $0</h2>
<p>
  This one's pretty self-explanatory. Some cards charge an annual fee depending
  upon how prestigious it is. A few cards have ways of avoiding the fee (usually
  only in the first year), but there are many great cards that charge nothing
  just for holding the card.
</p>
<h2>Sign-up Bonus - At the moment no signup bonus</h2>
<p>
  Credit cards can have bonuses as a result of signing up for the card,
  typically a fixed amount of money back or points after spending a certain
  amount within a set timeframe. Card lenders oftentimes offer signup bonus
  promotions with greater rewards than normal to incentivize people to apply for
  the companys' cards.
</p>
<h2>APRs - 0% for the first 18 months then 13.99% - 23.99% Variable</h2>
<p>
  APR is just a fancy term for the interest you'd have to pay on your credit
  card if you carry a balance. In order to avoid this, make sure that before or
  when you recieve your credit card bill, you pay it off in full. Paying the
  minimum amount will carry interest (unless you are still in your 0% APR
  period). The APR is variable dependent upon how good your credit is—the higher
  your credit score, the lower your APR (but try to never carry a balance).
</p>
<h2>Foreign Transaction Fee - 3%</h2>
<p>
  Foreign transaction fees are the fees that companies charge when you use your
  card abroad. There are many travel cards that don't charge foreign transaction
  fees, so if you plan to travel abroad, try to use those (and make sure they're
  Visa or Mastercard — Discover and AmEx are not as commonly accepted outside
  the US).
</p>
<h2>Balance Transfer Fee - 3%</h2>
<p>
  If you've carried a balance on a card before and accrued interest,
  transferring that balance to the Citi Double Cash would be ill-advised. 0%
  balance transfer fee cards are not _super_ common, but are recommended if
  you've had difficulties paying down interest in the past.

  There are a multitude of perks and characteristics that go into credit cards,
  but these cover the primary traits that one would look for when finding a new
  credit card. Follow-up in the future for a much more in-depth look at some
  ideas and methods of using credit cards to your advantage.

  <ins>Money is fungible.</ins>
</h2>

Fungibility is a concept touted by economist Richard Thaler in his 1999 paper [_Mental Accounting Matters_](<https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/(SICI)1099-0771(199909)12:3%3C183::AID-BDM318%3E3.0.CO;2-F>) published in the Journal of Behavioral Decision Making.
Thaler argues that a large number of people value money in different ways depending upon how it's earned, where it's stored, and which ways it's used. And yet,
money always has the same value, regardless of where you spend it. An easy example Richard Thaler brings up is tax refunds.
At the end of the year, when people who've overpaid on their taxes receive their money back, they become excited, thinking they've received a bunch of money. However, this money was theirs in the first place.
The only reason they're receiving it is that they paid too much in taxes. In actuality, up until the person is returned their tax refund, they've _lost_ money. And still, people celebrate like it's a paycheck that they've earned.

With ideas like Richard Thaler's, I'll try to help you understand more about spending appropriately and in what ways you can do it.
